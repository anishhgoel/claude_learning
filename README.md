Success Criteria are:
Specific : Clearly define what is to be achieved. E.g. Instead of good performance, specify accurate sentiment classification
Measurable : Use quantitative metrics or well defined qualitative sets. 

Quantitative Metrics: 

- Task-specific : F1 score, BLEU score, perplexity
- Generic : Accuracy, Percision, Recall
- Operational : Response time(ms), uptime(%)

Quantitative method: 

- A/B testing : Compare performance against a baseline model or earlier model
- User feedback : Implicit measures like task completion rates.
- Edge case analysis : Percentage of edge cases handled without errors.

Qualitative scales:
- Likert Scales : Rate coherence from 1 (nonsensical) to 5 (perfectly logical)
- Expert Rubrics : Linguistics rating translation quality on defined criteria
